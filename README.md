# Week-2-challenge
Developer portfolio draft
Project title: Conor Grogan portfolio (HTML & CSS)
Portfolio created using HTML & CSS (No bootstrap). I have included a nav bar with anchor links tht divert to their respective sections. There is also a color transition on hover.
My name is contained within the header and also has a color transition on hover.
The sections are divided into home,about,projects and contact.
The projects section images are link that divert to my GitHub page. There is a very slight aplha transition on hover with these sections. 0.9 - 1.0.
The image on project 1 is intended to be the main project highlighted.
I had an issue with the smaller images on project:2 and project 3:scaling scaling appropirately when the screen is halfed or otherwise made smaller. 
The contact me section contains a working link that goes to my GitHub
